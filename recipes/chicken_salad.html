        <h2>Ingredients in Chicken Salad</h2>
        <h3>Chicken:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Use leftovers from last night’s dinner or leftover rotisserie chicken or grilled chicken.</li>
            <li>To Make Chicken for chicken salad I like to use either poached chicken or baked chicken breasts or thighs.</li>
            <li>You can use canned chicken in a pinch but of course fresh is best when possible.</li>
            <li>Ensure the chicken is cooled and shred or chop the chicken into bite sized pieces.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Add-ins:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>As this is a classic chicken salad recipe, I’ve kept the additions to a minimum. Celery for crunch, green onions for flavor.</li>
            <li>This recipe can be made with a variety of nuts, veggies, and fruit for added flavor and texture.</li>
            <li>Chicken salad with grapes, avocado or dried cranberries is a favorite. Pecans or almonds pair well with this recipe.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Dressing:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Mayonnaise is the base of this recipe and it’s simply seasoned.</li>
            <li>You can get creative and substitute some of the mayo for ranch dressing or your favorite salad dressing recipe.</li>
            <li>Create an Avocado Chicken Salad by replacing some of the mayonnaise with mashed avocado.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How to Make Chicken Salad?</h2>
        <p>Prepare a classic chicken salad in 15 minutes with only a few simple ingredients.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop cooked and cooled chicken and place into a large bowl with celery and onions.</li>
            <li>Mix dressing ingredients (per recipe below) in a bowl. Toss with chicken.</li>
            <li>Serve on rolls, bread or over a bead of lettuce.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>For this chicken salad sandwich recipe, any bread will do, thick slices of a baguette or buns/rolls hold up well. This is naturally low carb and it’s great over a tossed salad as well.</p>
        <h2>Got Leftovers?</h2>
        <p><strong>REFRIGERATOR:</strong> In an airtight container, the chicken salad will last about a week in the refrigerator. Give it a stir and refresh the flavor with a little salt and pepper (or an extra dollop of Dijon mustard) and serve!</p>
        <p><strong>FREEZER:</strong> Chicken salad doesn’t freeze well. To prep ahead, simply dice the chicken and freeze. When ready to make, combine it with the ingredients below for a quick lunch!</p>
