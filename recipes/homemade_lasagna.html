        <p><em><strong>Homemade Lasagna </strong>is a classic that every cook should have in their rotation. Tender sheets of pasta, a cheese filling, and a rich meaty tomato sauce make the perfect dish!</em></p>
        <p>While there are a few steps to this recipe, it’s easy to make and has huge flavor. This dish can be made ahead of time and freezes well either before or after baking!</p>
        <h2>How to Make Lasagna</h2>
        <p>Homemade lasagna may have a few steps, but each step is easy - and I assure you it’s worth the time; the perfect Italian meal!</p>
        <p>The ingredients in this recipe are all things you know and it’s not difficult at all! All you’ll need for this easy lasagna recipe is one pan, one bowl, and a 9×13 baking dish!</p>
        <p>A quick overview of the layers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cheese Filling </strong>Mix the ricotta and cheeses (per recipe below) with an egg in a bowl, and set aside. No ricotta? No problem, cottage cheese works just fine in this recipe!</li>
            <li><strong>Meat Sauce </strong>Brown the onion, garlic, and meat in a pot on the stovetop. Add the pasta sauce and tomato paste & simmer a few minutes</li>
            <li><strong>Layer Together </strong>Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with noodles and bake until bubbling</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>SPINACH LASAGNA </strong>To make a spinach lasagna, squeeze out most of the moisture of defrosted frozen spinach and add it along with the cheese layer. Lasagna ingredients don’t have to be limited to the ones you see here.</p>
        <p>Substitute meats or different cheeses, or try different meat sauce variations.</p>
        <h2>How to Layer Lasagna</h2>
        <p>Once you have prepared the meat sauce and cheeses, you’re ready to layer. This is the order of layers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>sauce – noodles – cheese</li>
            <li>sauce – noodles – cheese</li>
            <li>sauce – noodles – cheese</li>
            <li>noodles – sauce (bake) – cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Spread about a cup of meat sauce into a 9×13 pan. Add a layer of noodles.</li>
            <li>Top the noodles with some of the cheese mixture.</li>
            <li>Repeat the layers, ending with a layer of noodles and sauce</li>
            <li>Cover with foil and bake.</li>
            <li>Remove foil, top with mozzarella and parmesan and bake another 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>How long to Bake</h2>
        <p>Baking time lasagna for this recipe is about one hour total. To get that perfect browned cheese topping, you’ll need to bake it in two stages.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Layer, cover it tightly in foil to retain the moisture.</li>
            <li>Once cooked, remove the foil, top with cheese, and return to the oven for another 15 minutes, or until the top is browned and your easy lasagna is bubbling.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Important Tip: </strong>Let the lasagna sit/rest for at least 15 minutes once removed from the oven (even 30-45 minutes is fine). This will keep it from becoming runny and help it to keep its shape when cut.</p>
        <p><em>Resting is not required when reheating.</em></p>
        <p>Serve this easy lasagna with a chunk of Homemade Garlic Bread.</p>
